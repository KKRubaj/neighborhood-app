It makes use of the Google Maps API and Foursquare API to show the current top ten recommended theatres in Warsaw, Poland. The locations are displayed both as markers on the map, and are available in a list by clicking the icon 'hamburger menu'. Selecting a location, either by clicking a marker or a list item, will display more information about that location. This informations are loaded from the Foursquare API. Locations can be filtered by name using input search above the list.
